## About The Project

Catwalk is the collaborative efforts of 4 software engineers within a 5 day time frame. This project simulated real-world development of a product page, complete with an image gallery, add-to-cart features, reviews, questions and answers with support for user uploaded images.

## How to Install and Run

### Installation
1. Get a GitHub API token with the permissions described [below](#update-your-config-with-github-auth-token).

### Update your config with Github Auth Token
To access the GitHub API without rate limits, you'll need a personal access token with the following scopes:
- read:org
- user
- read:user
- user:email
- user:follow

Make a copy of `config.example.js`, rename it to `config.js`, and add your personal access token.
